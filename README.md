# Installing Git on Linux:
1. Please write "git" on your command line (prompt). Hit enter. If your computer does not have a version of git yet, it will tell you exactly what to write in your next command line in order to install it;
2. Your computer will ask you for your user password. It will probably be the same password as the one you use to log in to your computer;
3. During the installation, write 'y' to continue;
4. After git has been installed, write 'git' again on your command line. A series of basic git command may appear. If this is the case, it means your computer has succesfully installed git and you're ready to use it!
